### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**

The most satisfying aspect was successfully deploying a complete, production-ready AWS cloud architecture for the Blood Donation Support System. From designing the initial architecture with VPC, subnets, and security groups, to implementing CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline and CodeBuild, and finally seeing the application running smoothly on EC2 with RDS database connectivity—every milestone felt like a significant achievement. Particularly rewarding was solving complex challenges like configuring API Gateway VPC Links, implementing SSH-less deployments using Systems Manager, and automating CloudFront cache invalidation. The moment when I successfully connected to the EC2 instance via Session Manager without SSH keys and deployed the Spring Boot application was incredibly satisfying. Additionally, receiving positive feedback from mentors during the mid-stage presentation and seeing the system handle real-world scenarios validated all the hard work.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**

While the internship experience was excellent overall, I believe a few enhancements could make it even better:

1. **Structured Learning Path**: A more detailed week-by-week learning roadmap with specific AWS service focus areas would help interns plan their learning journey better.

2. **Peer Collaboration**: More opportunities for interns to collaborate on projects or share knowledge through peer review sessions would enhance the learning experience.

3. **Cost Monitoring Dashboard**: Providing interns with a shared dashboard to monitor AWS costs across all projects would help develop cost optimization awareness from the start.

4. **Documentation Templates**: Pre-defined templates for architecture diagrams, deployment guides, and troubleshooting documentation would help maintain consistency and quality.

5. **Regular Check-ins**: More frequent one-on-one check-ins (bi-weekly instead of monthly) would help catch issues earlier and provide better guidance.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**

Absolutely, I would highly recommend this internship program to friends interested in cloud computing and AWS. Here's why:

**Pros:**
- **Hands-on Experience**: Unlike many internships that focus on theoretical learning, this program provides real, production-level projects that you can showcase in your portfolio.
- **Mentor Support**: The mentors are knowledgeable, patient, and genuinely invested in your growth. They guide you without spoon-feeding, which builds problem-solving skills.
- **Comprehensive Learning**: The 12-week program covers everything from basic EC2 setup to advanced topics like CI/CD, monitoring, and security best practices.
- **Industry-Relevant Skills**: The skills learned here (CloudFormation, CodePipeline, Systems Manager, etc.) are directly applicable to real-world DevOps and cloud engineering roles.
- **Portfolio Project**: You end up with a complete, deployable project that demonstrates your AWS expertise to future employers.

**Considerations:**
- Requires self-motivation and proactive learning—not ideal for those who prefer highly structured, step-by-step guidance.
- The learning curve can be steep, especially for beginners in cloud computing.

Overall, this internship is perfect for students who want to transition from academic knowledge to industry-ready skills in cloud computing.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**

1. **Workshop Series**: Organize monthly workshops on specific AWS services (e.g., "Deep Dive into CloudWatch" or "Advanced VPC Networking") with hands-on labs.

2. **Guest Speakers**: Invite AWS Solutions Architects or engineers from partner companies to share real-world case studies and industry insights.

3. **Project Showcase**: Organize a demo day at the end of the internship where interns can present their projects to the broader team and receive feedback.

4. **Code Review Sessions**: Regular code review sessions where mentors review CloudFormation templates, buildspec files, and deployment scripts would improve code quality.

5. **Cost Optimization Challenge**: Introduce a monthly challenge to optimize AWS costs while maintaining functionality, with recognition for the most innovative solutions.

6. **Resource Library**: Create a shared knowledge base with common troubleshooting guides, architecture patterns, and best practices compiled from all intern projects.

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**

Yes, I would be very interested in continuing this program in the future, either as:
- A returning intern to work on more advanced projects or mentor new interns
- A part-time contributor to help maintain and improve the workshop materials
- A collaborator on open-source improvements to the infrastructure templates

The experience has been invaluable, and I would love to contribute back to the program that helped me grow so much.

**Any other comments (free sharing):**

This internship has been a transformative experience. Coming in with basic AWS knowledge from university courses, I'm leaving with confidence in designing, deploying, and managing production-grade cloud infrastructure. The Blood Donation Support System project taught me not just technical skills, but also the importance of documentation, security-first thinking, cost optimization, and systematic problem-solving.

The challenges I faced—from debugging API Gateway VPC Links to implementing SSH-less deployments—forced me to think critically and develop resilience. The mentor's approach of guiding rather than giving answers was initially frustrating but ultimately made me a better engineer.

I'm particularly grateful for:
- The freedom to explore and implement solutions beyond the basic requirements
- The constructive feedback during presentations that helped refine both technical and communication skills
- The exposure to real-world scenarios like handling deployment failures, optimizing costs, and troubleshooting production issues

This internship has solidified my interest in pursuing a career in cloud engineering and DevOps. The hands-on experience with AWS services, combined with the mentorship and collaborative environment, has prepared me well for future roles in the industry.

Thank you to the entire FCJ team for this incredible opportunity!
