During my internship at **First Cloud AI Journey Office (FCJ)** from **September 2025** to **DECEMBER 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply cloud computing knowledge to a real-world AWS environment.  
I participated in the **AWS Cloud Journey internship program**, where I completed a comprehensive 12-week learning journey and deployed a production-ready web application architecture on AWS. Through this project, I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, AWS services, Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation), CI/CD pipelines, monitoring and observability, security best practices, and problem-solving in cloud environments**.

The main project involved designing and implementing a complete AWS web application architecture including:

- **Edge Layer**: Route 53, CloudFront CDN, AWS WAF, ACM Certificate, S3 static hosting
- **Networking**: VPC, subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Security Groups, VPC Flow Logs
- **Compute & Database**: EC2 with Auto Scaling, RDS, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito
- **CI/CD**: GitLab, CodePipeline, CodeBuild with automated deployments
- **Monitoring & Security**: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, SNS alerts, IAM, Secrets Manager

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with mentors and colleagues to improve work efficiency. I maintained detailed worklogs documenting my progress, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented throughout the 12-week period.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Strengths

- **Strong Learning Ability**: I demonstrated quick adaptation to new AWS services and concepts. When encountering unfamiliar services like API Gateway VPC Link or CloudFront OAC, I proactively researched documentation and implemented solutions effectively.

- **Proactive Approach**: I took initiative in exploring advanced features beyond basic requirements, such as implementing SSH-less deployment using AWS Systems Manager and automating CloudFront cache invalidation in CI/CD pipelines.

- **Technical Documentation**: I maintained comprehensive worklogs with detailed documentation of architecture decisions, challenges faced, and solutions implemented, which will be valuable for future reference and knowledge sharing.

- **Responsibility and Quality**: I consistently completed weekly tasks on schedule and ensured quality by thorough testing at each stage of the project, from edge layer setup to final end-to-end testing.

### Needs Improvement

- **Time Management and Discipline**: While I completed all tasks, I sometimes struggled with time management when dealing with complex issues like API Gateway VPC Link configuration or CloudWatch alarm troubleshooting. I need to improve my ability to estimate task duration more accurately and allocate time more effectively.

- **Problem-Solving Efficiency**: When facing technical challenges (such as RDS connection issues or Cognito JWT token validation), I sometimes spent too much time troubleshooting before seeking help or consulting documentation. I should develop a more systematic approach to problem-solving: first checking documentation, then testing systematically, and finally seeking guidance when needed.

- **Communication Skills**: I need to improve my ability to communicate technical issues and solutions more clearly, especially when presenting architecture decisions or explaining complex configurations to team members. This includes better documentation of troubleshooting steps and more effective verbal communication during team discussions.

- **Cost Optimization Awareness**: Initially, I focused more on functionality than cost optimization. For example, VPC Flow Logs generated high CloudWatch costs before I implemented retention policies and S3 storage. I should consider cost implications earlier in the design phase.

### Reflection

This internship provided invaluable hands-on experience with AWS cloud services and best practices. The challenges I encountered, such as configuring API Gateway VPC Links, implementing SSH-less deployments, and troubleshooting CloudWatch alarms, have significantly strengthened my problem-solving skills and technical knowledge.

The project taught me the importance of:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Using CloudFormation for reproducible deployments
- **Security First**: Implementing least-privilege IAM policies and network segmentation
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Establishing comprehensive logging and alerting
- **Automation**: Reducing manual errors through CI/CD pipelines
- **Documentation**: Maintaining detailed records for troubleshooting and knowledge transfer

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this comprehensive AWS project and look forward to applying these skills in future cloud architecture and DevOps roles.
