### [Blog 1 - Accelerating Enterprise ML Experimentation with Amazon SageMaker AI and Comet](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces how to integrate Amazon SageMaker AI with Comet to accelerate enterprise machine learning experimentation. You will learn how to manage ML experiments, track model lineage, and ensure reproducibility in production environments. The article demonstrates a complete fraud detection workflow using SageMaker AI + Comet, showcasing experiment tracking, model comparison, and audit-ready logging that modern enterprises require. It covers both administrator and user journeys, from setting up the Comet Partner AI App to running experiments and comparing results in the Comet UI.

### [Blog 2 - Using Apache Airflow workflows to orchestrate data processing on Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog demonstrates how to use Apache Airflow workflows to orchestrate data processing pipelines on Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio. You will learn how to build, test, and run end-to-end ML pipelines using SageMaker workflows through the Unified Studio interface. The article walks through a practical example that includes ingesting weather and taxi data, transforming and merging datasets, then using ML to predict taxi fares - all orchestrated through SageMaker Unified Studio workflows powered by Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA). It focuses on the code-based approach using Python DAGs for workflow management.

### [Blog 3 - Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Using Microservices](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices…), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. The article explains how to decompose services into smaller, loosely coupled microservices connected via a pub/sub hub pattern. It also guides you through architecture decisions, including using AWS CloudFormation cross-stack references, Amazon SNS for messaging, and specialized connectors for different healthcare data formats like HL7v2 messages.
