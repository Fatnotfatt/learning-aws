### [Blog 1 - Accelerating Enterprise ML Experimentation with Amazon SageMaker AI and Comet](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces how to integrate Amazon SageMaker AI with Comet to accelerate enterprise machine learning experimentation. You will learn how to manage ML experiments, track model lineage, and ensure reproducibility in production environments. The article demonstrates a complete fraud detection workflow using SageMaker AI + Comet, showcasing experiment tracking, model comparison, and audit-ready logging that modern enterprises require. It covers both administrator and user journeys, from setting up the Comet Partner AI App to running experiments and comparing results in the Comet UI.

### [Blog 2 - Using Apache Airflow workflows to orchestrate data processing on Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog demonstrates how to use Apache Airflow workflows to orchestrate data processing pipelines on Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio. You will learn how to build, test, and run end-to-end ML pipelines using SageMaker workflows through the Unified Studio interface. The article walks through a practical example that includes ingesting weather and taxi data, transforming and merging datasets, then using ML to predict taxi fares - all orchestrated through SageMaker Unified Studio workflows powered by Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA). It focuses on the code-based approach using Python DAGs for workflow management.

### [Blog 3 - Migrating full-text search from SQL Server to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog guides you on how to migrate full-text search from SQL Server to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. You will learn how to migrate FTS queries and schema structures, as the implementation differs between the two systems. The article demonstrates how to use PostgreSQL's tsvector and tsquery data types to achieve similar FTS functionality, and also shows how to implement FTS using the pg_trgm and pg_bigm extensions. It covers various use cases including CONTAINS predicates, FREETEXT queries, ranking with RANK, and performance optimization techniques using GIN indexes and stored generated columns.
