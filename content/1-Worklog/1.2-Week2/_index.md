### Week 2 Goals:

* Build a strong understanding of Amazon VPC, focusing on its key components: CIDR blocks, subnets, route tables, and ENIs.
* Learn how to secure VPCs using both Security Groups and Network ACLs, and understand their differences in scope and use cases.
* Explore AWS networking services such as VPN and Direct Connect to understand options for hybrid and enterprise connectivity.
* Study Elastic Load Balancing and its role in distributing traffic for high availability.
* Gain hands-on practice with VPC essentials: creating subnets, configuring route tables, attaching internet gateways, working with EBS, and managing Elastic IPs.
* Strengthen skills in accessing and managing EC2 instances securely via SSH.
* Implement advanced networking scenarios, including Hybrid DNS resolution with Route 53 Resolver.
* Practice connecting multiple VPCs through VPC Peering.
* Deploy AWS Transit Gateway to design and manage scalable multi-VPC architectures.

**Direction:** The goal of Week 2 was not only to expand theoretical knowledge of AWS networking but also to translate that knowledge into practical experience, laying a foundation for building and managing complex cloud infrastructures.
