### Week 5 Goals:

In this week, my main goal was to grasp the concepts and services related to security in AWS, including shared responsibility models, access management, encryption, and securing resources. I also became familiar with AWS tools and services to apply them in practical exercises.

The specific goals included:
* Understand the **Share Responsibility Model** of AWS.
* Master key AWS security services: **IAM**, **Cognito**, **Security Hub**, **KMS**, and **Identity Center**.
* Improve skills in managing resources and security through **IAM Permissions Boundary**, **Resource Tags**, and encryption techniques.

### Tasks to be Implemented This Week:

### Achievements of Week 5:

This week, I achieved significant progress in mastering AWS security services and applying theoretical knowledge into practical tasks. Specifically:

1. **Understanding and Applying the Share Responsibility Model of AWS**:
    - I gained a clear understanding of how AWS shares responsibility with customers for securing infrastructure and applications. This helped me define my role in managing security while deploying services on AWS.

2. **Theoretical Knowledge of Key AWS Security Services**:
    - **Amazon IAM**: Learned how to create and manage **IAM Users**, **Roles**, and **Policies**, helping me control access to resources.
    - **Amazon Cognito**: Explored how to manage user authentication for applications in AWS.
    - **AWS Identity Center**: Investigated how to connect users to AWS services through Identity Center.
    - **AWS Security Hub**: Configured and used it for security monitoring and threat detection.
    - **AWS KMS**: Practiced encrypting data at rest and securing sensitive data with encryption keys.

3. **Practical Application of AWS Security Services**:
    - Successfully set up and configured **AWS Security Hub** to monitor security issues, detecting vulnerabilities early.
    - Configured **IAM Permissions Boundary** to restrict user permissions and ensure minimal access.
    - **Optimizing EC2 Costs with Lambda**: Used Lambda to automate the stopping of idle EC2 instances to reduce costs.
    - Managed EC2 access with **IAM Policies** and **Resource Tags**.

4. **Improved Resource Management and Security Skills**:
    - Created and managed **IAM Groups** and **Policies** to control user access efficiently.
    - Explored **AWS Organizations** for managing multiple AWS accounts and ensuring consistent security policies across the organization.

### Conclusion:

In Week 5, I significantly improved my ability to use AWS security and access management tools. These skills form the foundation for implementing security solutions and cost optimization in upcoming AWS projects. The practical exercises helped me consolidate theory and enhance my ability to use AWS in real-world scenarios.
