During my internship, I participated in three events. Each one was a memorable experience that provided new, interesting, and useful knowledge, along with gifts and wonderful moments.

### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 15, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Outcomes or Value Gained:**

- **Lessons Learned**: I learned about the complete AWS AI/ML ecosystem, from Amazon SageMaker for traditional ML to Amazon Bedrock for Generative AI. I gained deep understanding of prompt engineering techniques like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Few-shot learning. I also learned about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture and how it's crucial for building accurate GenAI applications. The importance of guardrails for AI safety and content filtering in production applications was also emphasized.
- **New Skills**: I developed skills in using Amazon SageMaker Studio for ML model development and deployment. I learned how to implement RAG architecture for knowledge base integration. I gained practical knowledge of prompt engineering and how to build Bedrock Agents for multi-step workflows. I also learned about different foundation models (Claude, Llama, Titan) and when to use each one.
- **Contribution to Team/Project**: I shared comprehensive notes about SageMaker capabilities and Bedrock features with my team. I identified opportunities to implement RAG solutions for our domain-specific applications. I proposed pilot projects using Bedrock Agents for customer service automation. I also created guidelines for prompt engineering best practices and guardrail implementation for our GenAI projects.

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 14:00, October 3, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Event Hall, L26 Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Outcomes or Value Gained:**

- **Lessons Learned**: I gained a deep understanding of how generative AI is changing software development. The event showed me how AI can help throughout the entire development lifecycle, from planning to maintenance. I learned that while AI tools are powerful, human judgment is still crucial. I also understood that we should adopt AI tools gradually and ensure the whole team is aligned.
- **New Skills**: I learned how to use Amazon Q Developer for code generation, debugging, and documentation. I also explored Kiro and discovered how it can enhance my productivity. I developed skills in identifying which tasks can benefit from AI automation and learned how to balance AI assistance with human review to maintain code quality.
- **Contribution to Team/Project**: I documented the key takeaways from the event and shared them with my team. I identified specific projects where we could pilot AI tools, which could improve our development speed by 20-30% for repetitive tasks. I created guidelines for using AI tools in our workflow and planned to organize internal training sessions. The knowledge I gained helps our team stay competitive by using cutting-edge AI development tools.

### [Event 3](4.3-Event3/)

&emsp;**Event Name:** DevOps on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 17, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Đ. Hải Triều, Bến Nghé, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Outcomes or Value Gained:**

- **Lessons Learned**: I learned about DevOps culture and principles, including DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, MTTR, Change Failure Rate) for measuring DevOps maturity. I gained deep understanding of AWS CI/CD services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) and different deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling). I also learned about Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation and CDK, and when to use each approach.
- **New Skills**: I developed skills in building complete CI/CD pipelines using AWS DevOps services. I learned how to implement Infrastructure as Code with both CloudFormation and CDK. I gained practical knowledge of container services (ECR, ECS, EKS, App Runner) and when to use each one. I also learned how to set up monitoring and observability using CloudWatch and X-Ray.
- **Contribution to Team/Project**: I shared comprehensive notes about AWS DevOps services and best practices with my team. I proposed implementing CI/CD pipelines using CodePipeline for automated deployments. I suggested adopting Infrastructure as Code for all our infrastructure using CloudFormation or CDK. I also created guidelines for containerization strategies and monitoring best practices. The knowledge gained helps our team implement modern DevOps practices and improve deployment frequency and reliability.
